# Moneytor (💸 + 👀)

## What is the concept of Moneytor?

> Moneytor = 'Money' + 'to monitor'

#TODO: delete the skip function on the welcome screen

Moneytor is an open source software designed to help people manage their finances. The user can put in all of his/her expenses and incomes and sort them based on different parameters.
Moneytor provides multiple ways to visualize the finances. The user can play with different filters to better analyze his/her finances.

The data is stored in a .csv spreadsheet, and is managed via the interface of our desktop application.

## What are the different features?

- First, let's set up the application:
  - Enter your **name**
  - Set a **password**
  - Choose your **preferred currency**

- Enter an **amount** of money and fill in:
  - The **name**
  - The **category** 
  - The **date** (if it's not the current date)
  - If it's an income or an expense
  - The **currency**

- Update or delete existing data

- You can create **projects** to organize your expenses (and then set up different settings)

- Data vizualisation (with filters)

## Interim Report for the Term Project 

We managed to implement most of the features we wanted to have for our Application. And a little bit more.
Due to the lack of time, unfortunately, we have not managed to edit or delete entries. Also, as of now, there is only one .csv file in which all the finances are stored. This means that logging in using an account so far only changes the preferred currency but not the displayed data. Due to time constraints, we have decided to leave it at that, as we are mainly focuesed on demonstrating the functions of our program.
Speaking of which, as a bonus, we have managed to transfer the currency of the saved entries to the user's preferred currency. In doing so, we use live data. At the moment, unfortunately, this takes a lot of time, so we implemented this feature only for the plots, but not for the project list. We have some ideas how to change this problem in the future, but unfortunately we didn't have the time to do so until the submission.
For the future we would also like to provide more plots for data visualization/analysis as well as implement more filters.

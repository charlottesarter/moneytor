# Moneytor (ðŸ’¸ + ðŸ‘€)

## What is the concept of Moneytor?

> Moneytor = 'Money' + 'to monitor'

Moneytor is an open source software designed to help people manage their finances. The user can put in all of his/her expenses and incomes and sort them based on different parameters.
Moneytor provides multiple ways to visualize the finances. The user can play with different filters to better analyze his/her finances.

The data is stored in a .csv spreadsheet, and is managed via the interface of our desktop application.

## What are the different features?

- First, let's set up the application:
  - Enter your **name**
  - Set a **password**
  - Choose your **preferred currency**

- Enter an **amount** of money and fill in:
  - The **name**
  - The **category** 
  - The **date** (if it's not the current date)
  - If it's an income or an expense
  - The **currency**

- Update or delete existing data

- You can create **projects** to organize your expenses (and then set up different settings)

- Data vizualisation (with filters)

> Our goal is to implement a maximum of our ideas.
> Our first ideas for the design can be seen in the images folder.
